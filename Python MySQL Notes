Use buffered=True when:

You only partially fetch data (e.g., using fetchone() or fetchmany()) and:

You close the cursor right after.

Or run another query with the same cursor or connection.

You want to:

Count rows using len(cursor) or cursor.rowcount (this only works if the result set is buffered).
