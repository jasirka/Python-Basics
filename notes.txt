For complex nos, multiplication real part and imaguinary part will do cross multiplication i square and jsquare wil be -1
For complex nos, division multiply with conjugate means multiply with complex nos that are opposite sign from the denominator.

Example:
a = 2+3j 
b = 4+5j
a * b = 2 * 4 + 2 * 5j + 3j * 4 + 3j * 5j = 8 + 10j + 12j + 15j**2 [ put -1 for j**2 ]
a / b = (2+3j) * (4-5j) / (4+5j) * (4-5j)

Enumerate type is used to to use indexing for the immutable types like tuples, strings etc

Example:
x = ["apple", "orange", "lemon"]
y = enumerate(x)
print(list(y))     #then we can iterate over the tuple
