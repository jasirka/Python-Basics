For complex nos, multiplication real part and imaguinary part will do cross multiplication i square and jsquare wil be -1
For complex nos, division multiply with conjugate means multiply with complex nos that are opposite sign from the denominator.

Example:
a = 2+3j 
b = 4+5j
a * b = 2 * 4 + 2 * 5j + 3j * 4 + 3j * 5j = 8 + 10j + 12j + 15j**2 [ put -1 for j**2 ]
a / b = (2+3j) * (4-5j) / (4+5j) * (4-5j)

Enumerate type is used to to use indexing for the immutable types like tuples, strings etc

Example:
x = ["apple", "orange", "lemon"]
y = enumerate(x)
print(list(y))     #then we can iterate over the tuple 

Difference between slicing and insert in list
list = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]  # replaced the element
list[1:3] = ["citrus", "pine apple"]  
list.insert(2, "lemon")               # shift the element and insert in that position

Difference between list() and copy() method for copying list items
list1 = [45,78,89,23]
list_copy = list1.copy() # this will point to list1. 
list_copy1 = list(list1) # this will create a new list different from the original list

Use sorted() fn to sort tuple elements

Generator returns values each time with yield statement.
Generator is a type of iterator.
All generators are iterators. But not viceversa

Example:
def generate_numbers(n):
    yield n

print(generate_numbers(5))

output
0   1   2   3    4

For tuples with single element, it should add a comma at the end of the element
Eg: ('hii',)
